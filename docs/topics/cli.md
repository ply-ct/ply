# CLI
The CLI is how you can run Ply directly from the command line and also automatically as part of your 
continuous integration cycle. Running ply without any arguments will execute all requests/cases (except
those that are ignored or skipped).

## Command-Line Only Arguments

| Option | Default |
| :----- | :------ |
| **<code>-h</code>** | Show help
| **<code>--version, -v</code>** | Show version number
| **<code>--config, -c</code>** | Specify path to [plyconfig file](config) (overrides default search mechanism)
| **<code>--submit, -s</code>** | Submit requests but don't verify actual results against expected (ad hoc run)
| **<code>--import</code>** | Import requests or values from specified format. Currently 'postman' is the only supported format. *Overwrites* existing same-named files.
| **<code>--openapi</code>** | Augment OpenAPI spec with Ply example requests/responses and code samples. *Overwrites* existing OpenAPI spec file.
| **<code>--create</code>** | Create expected result file from actual responses
| **<code>--useDist</code>** | Import case modules from build output (eg dist) instead of from TypeScript sources
