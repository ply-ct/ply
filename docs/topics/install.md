## Command Line Interface
Install Ply through [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ply-ct) to use the CLI.
1. Global
   ```
   npm install -g @ply-ct/ply
   ```
   This way you can run `ply` directly from the command line:
   ```
   ply --version
   ```
1. Dev Dependency
   ```
   npm install --save-dev @ply-ct/ply
   ```
   Then you can run ply in your project directory through `npx`:
   ```
   npx ply --version
   ```
Command-line exercises in this guide assume you have Ply installed globally.
