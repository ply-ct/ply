<h1>Ply is meant to be easy</h1>
<div class="site-content">
<p>
We invented Ply because automated API testing should be a pleasure. Not a laborious exercise in field-by-field response validations.
If tests are easier to build, they're more likely to be comprehensive.
</p>
<p>
Postman and Insomnia are both awesome tools for sending HTTP requests. Where they fall short is in automated testing.

## Comparison
<div class="site-content" style="max-width:1205px">
<p>
For super complex scenarios, a programmatic approach may be a necessary effort (and Ply <a href="topics/cases">supports that too</a>).
But for 90% of API testing Ply's workflow-driven, declarative approach is a more maintainable alternative.
</p>
<p>
For comparison let's look at a simple example: GitHub's REST API for retrieving repository topics. Ply uses YAML for expected/actual results.
<img src="./img/repo-topics-ply.png" width="1205">
Here's what a similar test looks like in <a href="https://blog.postman.com/writing-tests-in-postman/">Postman</a>:
<img src="./img/repo-topics-postman.png" width="1254">
</p>
<p>
Notice the difference? With Ply you maintain your expected response body as an entire JSON payload embedded in YAML; whereas in Postman you'll
need to craft JavaScript to evaluate each and every element. <a href="https://support.insomnia.rest/article/194-unit-testing">Insomnia tests</a>
work much the same way as Postman. Not only are Ply tests much easier to understand, but also they can be <a href="topics/flows#run-with-expected-results">auto-generated</a>
by capturing a good response.
</p>
<p>
But what about dynamic values? Isn't JavaScript better for that? Sure it is. That's what 
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals">template literals</a>
were invented for. Read about Ply's intuitive support for <a href="topics/values">dynamic expressions</a>. Most importantly, 
you'll want to reference properties from previous responses in subsequent requests. Like how 
<a href="https://github.com/ply-ct/ply-demo/blob/master/test/requests/github-api.ply.yaml#L45">ply-demo's starRepository</a>
GraphQL query cites the <code class="highlighter-rouge">id</code> grabbed by its upstream findRespositoryId request:
<pre class="highlight"><code>${@findRepositoryId.response.body.data.repository.id}</code></pre>
This way you can string together requests into a workflow, either declaratively in a <a href="topics/requests">YAML request suite</a>,
or graphically in a <a href="topics/flows">Ply flow</a>.
