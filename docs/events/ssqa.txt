Abstract:
Automated API Testing with Ply.

Ply's aim is easy automation of REST and GraphQL API testing. Its building blocks are reusable Requests strung together in graphical flows to orchestrate complex sequences of interdependent API invocations. The Ply VS Code extension enables designers to drag and drop Requests and other assets to create highly repeatable automated test suites which are well-suited for continuous testing in the context of a CI/CD pipeline.
